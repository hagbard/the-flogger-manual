# The Flogger Manual

Flogger is Google's open-source Java debug logging library. It's used extensively within Google 
to satisfy the needs of many hundreds of Java and Kotlin projects, and is the only debug logging
API that's supported by the core Java libraries team.

Flogger makes extensive use of the "fluent API" design pattern to provide an intuitive, powerful
API which can improve both the readability of log statements within code and the value of the
emitted logs.

With powerful features such as in-built rate limiting, structured metadata, logging contexts and
targeted log-level control, it gives users the tools they need to get the best from debug logs
for small or large scale applications.

Compatible with the JDK logging system, Log4J and other common logging frameworks, Flogger 
provides a powerful alternative for Java/Kotlin developers.
